Project Overview  

StealthEscape is a stealth-based AI game built within Minecraft, where an agent must navigate through a dynamically generated maze while avoiding detection by mobs (guards). The game world features random light sources, patrol routes, and safe zones. The AI must use reinforcement learning to adapt its strategy, balancing stealth and movement efficiency to reach the goal without being caught.
